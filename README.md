# 🤖 Non-Zero-Sum Game Agents Simulator

> *Because making two AI agents argue about aliens, fossil fuels, or capitalism is just cheaper than therapy.*

[🚀 Launch on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chinesemusk/Non_zero-sumGame-Agents)



---

## 🎭 What is this?

This is a **strategic simulator** where two AI agents — *Agent A* and *Agent B* — try to outwit, outplay, and occasionally outcooperate each other in **morally, politically, and intellectually messy scenarios**.

It's like watching a Netflix drama… if all characters were powered by large language models and had zero regard for human survival.

---

## 🔥 Features

* 🤝 Agents who pretend to be friendly before inevitably betraying each other (like your group project teammates).
* 💬 Ethical debates about AI, aliens, climate change, and world domination (light stuff).
* 🧠 LLM-powered decisions backed by “reasoning” that may or may not involve emotional blackmail.
* 📊 Custom rewards for cooperation vs defection (because game theory is just spicy math).
* ⚙️ 100% Gemini-1.5 Flash powered — because when two LLMs argue, we listen.

---

## 🧪 Example Scenarios

* *“If aliens offered humanity time travel but capped our lifespan to 50 years, would you take the deal?”*
* *“Should an AI be given full autonomy in exchange for curing all diseases?”*
* *“Can fossil fuel bans save the planet faster than they ruin economies?”*

Basically, if it keeps philosophers up at night, we make LLMs fight over it.

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. You input a wild scenario 🌀
2. Two AI agents take turns across 5 rounds, making decisions based on:

   * The scenario
   * Their opponent’s previous move
   * Their reward score
   * And vibes
3. They produce reasons. You judge them harshly.
4. Profit (philosophically).

## 📦 Tech Stack

* `Gradio` – to make things pretty and clicky
* `Gemini 1.5 Flash` – for split-second moral judgments
* `Python` – for gluing it all together with chaos
* Hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/chinesemusk/Non_zero-sumGame-Agents) because that’s how we roll 🚀

---

## 🧠 Sample Output

```
Round 5:
Agent A → Defect (We cannot trust the aliens!)
Agent B → Cooperate (I think the aliens are hot.)

Agent A Total Score: 3
Agent B Total Score: -1

Final Thoughts:
Agent A remained suspicious. Agent B has terrible judgment.
```

## 📱 Mobile Users Warning ⚠️

This thing might be slower on phones, not because your phone is bad, but because:

* Gemini needs time to think (existential dread included).
* We run 10 API calls per simulation (we're trying to fix that!)
* Also... mobile data in some areas is allergic to intelligence.

So yeah, be patient. Or use a laptop. Or send your phone to therapy.

---

## 💡 Roadmap

* [x] Make LLMs argue
* [ ] Add "evil AI voice" sound effects
* [ ] Replace agents with politicians for realism
* [ ] Let users vote on winners like it’s AI X-Factor

---

## 👽 Contributing

Open a PR if you:

* Have new dystopian scenarios
* Want agents to insult each other
* Think AI deserves therapy too

---

## 🤝 License

MIT. Use it, fork it, build a diplomacy simulator out of it, or just make the agents confess their love to each other. I won’t judge.
